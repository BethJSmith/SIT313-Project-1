A simple memory game app designed for iOS devices that follows a fruity theme.

The player is presented with a grid of hidden tiles. The player touches two of the tiles to reveal the image hidden underneath. If the pair is a match the tiles stay revealed, otherwise they are hidden and the player chooses again. The aim is to reveal all the tiles to win the game.

Each attempt will be timed and a high scores table will show the fastest times.
