A simple memory game app designed for iOS devices that follows a fruity theme.

### New game

Selecting a new game will present the game screen. The aim of the game is to click the fruit to reveal them and match all the pairs.

When all the pairs have been matched the app will show the time it took and you to input a name to add it to the scoreboard. You can also choose to skip this part. After this clicking continue will take you back to the home screen.

### High scores table

Clicking high scores on the home screen will take you to the high scores table. This is populated from a locally saved text file. The list is also scrollable.

### How to play

The option from the home screen is how to play. This explains to the user how to play the game and the description is populated from a text file so it can be changed easily if needed.
