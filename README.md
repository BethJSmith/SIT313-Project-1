# SIT313 Project 1 - Memory Game

## Project description

This project is for SIT313 Mobile Applications. I will be developing an app for a mobile system. The system I have chosen to develop for will be iOS.

## App description

A simple memory game app designed for iOS devices.

The player is presented with a grid of hidden tiles. The player touches two of the tiles to reveal the image hidden underneath. If the pair is a match the tiles stay revealed, otherwise they are hidden and the player chooses again. The aim is to reveal all the tiles to win the game.

Each attempt will be timed and a leaderboard will show the fastest times.
